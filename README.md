# A guide to learn opencv

Tutorial followed on **pyimagesearch.com** ([here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/19/opencv-tutorial-a-guide-to-learn-opencv/))

In this tutorial weâ€™ll be creating two Python scripts to help you learn OpenCV basics:

+ Our first script, `opencv_tutorial_01.py` will cover basic image processing operations using an image from the movie, Jurassic Park ( jp.png ).
    + Loading and displaying an image
    + Accessing individual pixels
    + Array slicing and cropping
    + Resizing images
    + Rotating an image
    + Smoothing an image
    + Drawing on a image
+ From there, `opencv_tutorial_02.py` will show you how to use these image processing building blocks to create an OpenCV application to count the number of objects in a Tetris image (tetris_blocks.png ).
    + Counting objects
    + Converting an image to grayscale
    + Edge detection
    + Thresholding
    + Detecting and drawing contours
    + Erosions and dilations
    + Masking and bitwise operations

python opencv_tutorial_02.py --image tetris_blocks.png
